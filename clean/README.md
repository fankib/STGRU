# Location Prediction over Sparse User Mobility Traces using RNNs: Flashback in Hidden States!

## Abstract
Location prediction is a key problem in human mo-
bility modeling, which predicts a userâ€™s next loca-
tion based on historical user mobility traces. As
a sequential prediction problem by nature, it has
been recently studied using Recurrent Neural Net-
works (RNNs). Due to the sparsity of user mo-
bility traces, existing techniques strive to improve
RNNs by considering spatiotemporal contexts. The
most adopted scheme is to incorporate spatiotem-
poral factors into the recurrent hidden state pass-
ing process of RNNs using context-parameterized
transition matrices or gates. However, such a
scheme oversimplifies the temporal periodicity and
spatial regularity of user mobility, and thus can-
not fully benefit from rich historical spatiotemporal
contexts encoded in user mobility traces. Against
this background, we propose Flashback, a general
RNN architecture designed for modeling sparse
user mobility traces by doing flashbacks on hid-
den states in RNNs. Specifically, Flashback ex-
plicitly uses spatiotemporal contexts to search past
hidden states with high predictive power (i.e., his-
torical hidden states sharing similar contexts as
the current one) for location prediction, which can
then directly benefit from rich spatiotemporal con-
texts. Our extensive evaluation compares Flash-
back against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art
techniques on two real-world LBSN datasets. Re-
sults show that Flashback consistently and signifi-
cantly outperforms state-of-the-art RNNs involving
spatiotemporal factors by 15.9% to 27.6% in the
next location prediction task.
